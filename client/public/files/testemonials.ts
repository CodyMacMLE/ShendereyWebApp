She took a little break for a couple years to do other activities but made the decision that gymnastics was her thing. We brought her back to do some rec classes when she was 6 and never turned back. She is now 14 years old, training 25 hours a week and comes home with a HUGE smile on her face every day - that's a win for me! Highly recommend!! Thank you to all the coaches at Shenderey, you guys are all amazing",

At the time I had visited a few local clubs and found by far that Shenderey Gymnastics was the best suited for us! Their coaching staff are amazing and their individual attention to each gymnast enrolled in their programs is above and beyond what I ever expected!! Very family oriented, great communication and the level of coaching is by far the best out there! We love it here and have recommended this club to others who are so happy we did!! Thank you Shenderey Gymnastics for having the impact in my daughter's life that you do, not only in the gym but also outside of the gym!! Keep up the great work!!",
